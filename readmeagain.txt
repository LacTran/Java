Here is my final project - GUI Simple Quiz
There are 3 classes in all, including menu, part1 and part2.

In short, when the code is executed, a menu panel should appear to let user choose between one of the two parts from the quiz to do.

In part1, there are 10 questions using JRadioButton type, each has 4 options. In the end, user will counter a report that stated questions, correct answers and the number of correct answers chosen.
In part2, there are 3 questions using JCheckBox, JComboBox and JTextField.
Comments are made throughout the codes as well.
